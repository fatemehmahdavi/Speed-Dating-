<p>Imagine sitting across from someone for just four minutes, trying to
decide if they could be your perfect match. This intriguing setup formed
the basis of Columbia University’s speed dating experiments, where
participants rated each other on attributes like Attractiveness,
Intelligence, and Fun, and decided whether they’d want to meet again.
But what truly drives these decisions? Let’s dive in to uncover the
hidden patterns of dating success.</p>
<div id="what-do-we-look-for-in-a-partner"
class="section level2 plot-container">
<h2>What Do We Look for in a Partner?</h2>
<p>When it comes to first impressions, not all attributes are equal. Men
and women value different things:</p>
<p>Men tend to prioritize Attractiveness and Fun. Women, on the other
hand, give more weight to Intelligence and Sincerity. This difference
reveals how societal norms and expectations shape what we find appealing
in a potential partner.</p>

<h2>Do Career Paths Shape Dating Preferences?</h2>
<p>Your career can say a lot about what you value in a partner:</p>
<p>STEM professionals lean towards Intelligence and Shared Interests,
perhaps seeking someone they can connect with intellectually. Those in
Creative Arts often value Fun and Ambition, suggesting a preference for
dynamic and exciting partnerships. This shows how our work can influence
what we want in our personal lives.</p>

<h2>Are Shared Interests the Key to a Match?</h2>
<p>Hobbies play a bigger role than you might think. Activities like
hiking and reading are strong indicators of match likelihood. Why?
Shared interests provide a common ground—a foundation for a
relationship. On the flip side, some hobbies, like gaming, have a weaker
connection to match success, possibly due to personal or cultural
biases.</p>
